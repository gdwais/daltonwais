# This Site

This site is a simple single page [React](https://reactjs.org/) application.  It originally started out with [this open source project](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template) on github that is easily customizeable and provides a nice look and feel right out of the box!  So thanks Tim Baker ;).

## Dynamic Markdown

I wanted to make the site a but more dynamic in the way it renders content so that I can easily add sections in the future so I build a quick dynamic markdown component.  If you aren't familiar - [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) is a lightweight markup language that's perfect for quickly producing well formatted and easily readable documentation.
